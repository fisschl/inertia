# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a TypeScript inertia library for n-dimensional space simulation with friction, supporting position/velocity tracking and realistic physics.

## Key Knowledge
- Using Bun as the runtime environment and build tool
- Project follows standard Bun library structure with src/ directory
- All files use lowercase naming convention with hyphens
- Unit tests are placed alongside implementation files (src/inertia.ts and src/inertia.test.ts)
- Examples are kept in separate examples/ directory
- VS Code configured with ESLint auto-fix on save and auto-save on focus change
- Testing done with Bun's built-in test framework
- Library supports any number of dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.)

## Recent Actions
- Implemented core Inertia class with n-dimensional support
- Added position and velocity tracking with friction simulation
- Implemented impulse application and rest detection functionality
- Created comprehensive test suite with 10 test cases covering all functionality
- Wrote usage examples demonstrating 1D, 2D, and 3D scenarios
- Configured proper project structure following community standards
- Set up VS Code development environment with ESLint integration
- All documentation and comments written in Chinese
- Removed unnecessary debug files and organized codebase
