# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a TypeScript library for simulating inertia and friction in n-dimensional space with proper testing and documentation.

## Key Knowledge
- Using Bun as the runtime environment and package manager
- TypeScript for type safety with strict mode enabled
- ESLint with @antfu/eslint-config for code quality
- Bun test framework for unit testing
- VS Code configured with auto-save and ESLint auto-fix on save
- Library follows standard Bun project structure with src/, examples/ directories
- All files use lowercase naming convention with hyphens
- No private properties or underscore prefixes in classes
- Using functions instead of getters for public API methods

## Recent Actions
- Restructured project to follow standard Bun library conventions
- Moved tests to src/ directory alongside implementation
- Removed redundant test.ts file
- Fixed ESLint errors by replacing console.log with console.info
- Updated Inertia class to remove private modifiers and underscore prefixes
- Replaced getter methods with explicit getter functions
- Updated all test and example files to use new API method names
- All unit tests passing (10/10)
- ESLint running without errors

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Restructure project to follow standard conventions
2. [DONE] Fix ESLint errors and code quality issues
3. [DONE] Update Inertia class API to remove getters and private properties
4. [DONE] Update all dependent files to use new API
5. [TODO] Run example file to verify functionality
6. [TODO] Final TypeScript compilation check
7. [TODO] Update documentation to reflect API changes
